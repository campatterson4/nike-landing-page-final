NIKE LANDING PAGE

This page highlights the Nike Air Max 270's and displays an eye-catching photo of the shoes and a detailed summary about them. I utilized the JavaScript scroll reveal 
library to load the image element and summary when the page is opened (or refreshed) at a delay and animate from the top and bottom of the screen. I also used the querySelector to lower
the font size and logo in the header when the user scrolls. When scrolled, the header becomes transparent with a blur so the user can still see a hint of the elements
below. I made this page to add to my portfolio and utilize cool techniques such as the transparent header and animations. 

Please let me know of any suggestions, thank you for reading!
